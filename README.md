#About This Game
On a remote frontier planet, survival is a brutal art. In Psychaos, ancient sects teach disciplines that merge psionic powers with martial arts, creating deadly fighters capable of warping minds and breaking bodies.

Engage in a turn-based combat system where every decision matters. Position, timing, and the synergy of psionic abilities with martial techniques determine whether you rise as a master or fall to those who are stronger, faster, and smarter.

Train under powerful sects, master unique combat styles, and carve your path in a world where every fight is a test of skill and willpower. This is not a war of armies—it’s a war for survival, one warrior at a time.
